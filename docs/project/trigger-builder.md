# NHL Overlay — Custom Trigger Builder: Plan & Tasks

## Feature Overview

End users can create **custom triggers** from the frontend. A trigger binds one or more **keywords** to a **natural language description** of data they want displayed. When those keywords are detected in the live audio (via fuzzy or LLM matching), the backend calls the pre-resolved NHL API endpoint and pushes the relevant fields to the overlay as a card.

The LLM is only involved **at trigger-creation time** — it reads the two NHL API spec files once, determines which endpoint best matches the description, and identifies which response fields to extract. At runtime, the backend simply calls that stored endpoint and maps the stored fields. No LLM call happens during live audio for custom triggers.

## End-to-End User Flow

```
[Frontend — Trigger Builder UI]
  User fills in:
    · Keywords:    "power play"
    · Description: "Show how many power play goals the Oilers have scored this season"
          │
          ▼ POST /triggers
[Backend — trigger_resolver.py]
  1. Load api_spec_A.md + api_spec_B.md
  2. Pre-filter sections by keyword overlap (ranker)
  3. Send top candidates + description to Claude
  4. Claude returns:
       {
         "endpoint": "https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/club-stats/EDM/now",
         "method": "GET",
         "path_params": { "team": "EDM" },    ← dynamic params noted
         "fields": [
           { "path": "skaters[].powerPlayGoals", "label": "PP Goals",  "type": "number" },
           { "path": "skaters[].firstName",      "label": "First Name", "type": "string" },
           { "path": "skaters[].lastName",       "label": "Last Name",  "type": "string" }
         ],
         "notes": "Filter skaters[] by playerId or sort by powerPlayGoals desc for leaders."
       }
  5. Trigger saved to triggers store:
       {
         "id": "uuid",
         "keywords": ["power play"],
         "description": "Show how many power play goals...",
         "endpoint": "https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/club-stats/EDM/now",
         "method": "GET",
         "fields": [...],
         "notes": "...",
         "enabled": true
       }
          │
          ▼
[Runtime — live audio pipeline]
  Transcript arrives → fuzzy/LLM entity extraction runs →
  "power play" matched against active trigger keywords →
  Backend calls stored endpoint →
  Extracts stored fields from response →
  Builds display payload →
  Broadcasts to overlay → TriggerCard rendered for 8s
```

POST   /triggers          — create trigger (calls resolver, saves result)
GET    /triggers          — list all triggers
PATCH  /triggers/{id}     — enable / disable a trigger
DELETE /triggers/{id}     — delete a trigger
```

## Backend Modules

### `trigger_resolver.py`
Called once when the user creates a trigger. Never called during live audio.

- Loads and sections both spec files
- Pre-filters sections by keyword overlap (same ranker logic as extractor)
- Sends top-N candidate sections + user description to Claude with a strict system prompt
- Claude returns a `TriggerResolution` JSON object (endpoint, method, fields, notes)
- Validates the response shape; raises if endpoint or fields are missing
- Returns the resolution to be stored alongside the trigger definition

**System prompt for resolver:**
```
You are an NHL API expert. You will receive:
  1. A natural language description of data an end user wants to display on a live broadcast overlay
  2. Candidate sections from two NHL API specification files

Your task:
  - Identify the single best-matching endpoint
  - List only the response fields that directly satisfy the description
    Each field must include: JSON path (dot notation), a short display label, and value type
  - If the endpoint requires dynamic path parameters (e.g. team abbreviation, player ID),
    note them in "path_params" so the backend knows what to substitute at runtime
  - If no section is a confident match, return { "endpoint": null, "error": "..." }
  - Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No markdown fences. No explanation outside the JSON.
```

### `trigger_store.py`
- In-memory dict `{ id: TriggerRecord }` loaded from / persisted to `triggers.json` on disk
- `TriggerRecord` shape:
  ```python
  {
    "id":          str,         # uuid4
    "keywords":    list[str],   # ["power play"] — 1–3 words
    "description": str,         # user's free-text intent
    "endpoint":    str,         # resolved URL (may contain {param} placeholders)
    "method":      str,         # "GET" (all NHL API endpoints are GET)
    "path_params": dict,        # { "team": "EDM" } — filled at creation; overridable at runtime
    "fields":      list[dict],  # [{ "path": "skaters[].ppGoals", "label": "PP Goals", "type": "number" }]
    "notes":       str | None,
    "enabled":     bool
  }
  ```
- Exposed functions: `create()`, `list_all()`, `get()`, `update()`, `delete()`
- Writes to `triggers.json` after every mutation so triggers survive a restart

### `trigger_runner.py`
Called during the live audio pipeline, after `extract_entities()`.

- `match_triggers(text: str, triggers: list[TriggerRecord]) -> list[TriggerRecord]`:
  - For each enabled trigger, check if any keyword matches the transcript using the same fuzzy/LLM logic used for players and teams (RapidFuzz threshold ≥ 85 or LLM extraction)
  - Returns all matching triggers (may be multiple)
- `run_trigger(trigger: TriggerRecord) -> dict | None`:
  - Substitutes any `{param}` placeholders in the endpoint URL (from `path_params`)
  - Makes an async `httpx.AsyncClient` GET request
  - Walks the response JSON using each stored field path (dot notation + array index support)
  - Returns a `TriggerPayload` dict ready for broadcast
- `build_trigger_payload(trigger: TriggerRecord, values: dict) -> dict`:
  ```json
  {
    "type":        "trigger",
    "id":          "uuid",
    "keywords":    ["power play"],
    "description": "Show how many power play goals...",
    "fields": [
      { "label": "PP Goals",   "value": 24 },
      { "label": "First Name", "value": "Connor" },
      { "label": "Last Name",  "value": "McDavid" }
    ],
    "display": "power play · PP Goals: 24 | Connor McDavid"
  }
  ```

## Frontend Modules

### `useTriggers.ts`
- `getTriggers()` — `GET /triggers`
- `createTrigger(keywords, description)` — `POST /triggers` — returns the full resolved trigger including endpoint and fields for the user to review
- `toggleTrigger(id, enabled)` — `PATCH /triggers/{id}`
- `deleteTrigger(id)` — `DELETE /triggers/{id}`
- Loading and error states per operation

### `TriggerBuilder.tsx`
- Two inputs: **Keywords** (tag-style input, 1–3 words) and **Description** (free text)
- Submit calls `createTrigger` → shows a loading state ("Resolving endpoint…") during the LLM call
- On success: shows a **resolution preview** before saving:
  ```
  ✓ Endpoint found: GET /v1/club-stats/EDM/now
  Fields to display:
    · PP Goals       (skaters[].powerPlayGoals)
    · First Name     (skaters[].firstName)
    · Last Name      (skaters[].lastName)
  Notes: Sort skaters[] by powerPlayGoals desc for leaders.
  ```
- User can confirm (saves) or cancel (discards)
- On failure (no endpoint found): show inline error — "Could not find a matching endpoint. Try rephrasing your description."

### `TriggerList.tsx`
- Table/list of all saved triggers: keywords, description, resolved endpoint, enabled toggle, delete button
- Enabled toggle calls `toggleTrigger`
- Delete button calls `deleteTrigger` with a confirmation prompt

### `TriggerCard.tsx`
- Receives `TriggerPayload` from the WebSocket
- Renders the keyword(s) as a header badge, then each `{ label, value }` field pair
- Same slide-in + 8s auto-dismiss animation as `StatCard` and `TeamCard`
- Visual identity: purple/violet accent to distinguish custom triggers from built-in player/team cards

---

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

Changes to `server.py`:
- Add the four `/triggers` REST routes
- In the main audio pipeline, after `extract_entities()`, also call `trigger_runner.match_triggers()` and run any matched triggers concurrently with the existing player/team stat fetches
- Broadcast `TriggerPayload` objects alongside player/team payloads — the frontend already handles multiple `type` values

Changes to `OverlayCanvas.tsx`:
- Add `TriggerCard` to the routing switch alongside `StatCard` and `TeamCard`
- `type: "trigger"` → `<TriggerCard>`

---

## Tasks

### SETUP

- [ ] **TRIG-SETUP-01** — Create `backend/specs/` directory; copy or symlink the two NHL API spec files there as `api_spec_A.md` and `api_spec_B.md`
- [ ] **TRIG-SETUP-02** — Create `backend/triggers.json` as an empty object `{}` — this is the persistence file for saved triggers
- [ ] **TRIG-SETUP-03** — Add `uuid` to `backend/requirements.txt` if not already present (stdlib in Python 3.11, no install needed — just verify `import uuid` works)

---

### RESOLVER — `backend/trigger_resolver.py`

- [ ] **TRIG-RES-01** — Implement `load_spec_sections(spec_a: str, spec_b: str) -> list[dict]`:
  - Split each file on `##` / `###` headings via regex
  - Return flat list of `{ "source": filename, "heading": str, "body": str }`
  - Strip sections with body under 20 characters
- [ ] **TRIG-RES-02** — Implement `prefilter_sections(sections: list[dict], keywords: list[str], description: str, top_n: int = 8) -> list[dict]`:
  - Score by keyword + key-word-from-description overlap in heading (×3) and body (×1)
  - Return top-N; fall back to first N if all scores are 0
- [ ] **TRIG-RES-03** — Write the resolver system prompt as a module-level constant:
  - Specifies output JSON shape: `endpoint`, `method`, `path_params`, `fields[]` (path, label, type), `notes`
  - Explicitly forbids inventing fields not present in the provided sections
  - Specifies the `{ "endpoint": null, "error": "..." }` failure shape
- [ ] **TRIG-RES-04** — Implement `resolve_trigger(keywords: list[str], description: str) -> dict`:
  - Load sections → prefilter → build prompt → call Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `max_tokens=1000`)
  - Strip markdown fences, `json.loads()`, validate required keys
  - Return resolution dict or raise `ValueError` with the error string from Claude's failure response
- [ ] **TRIG-RES-05** — Manual smoke test: call `resolve_trigger` with 3 descriptions and print the result; verify endpoint URLs look valid and fields look plausible

---

### STORE — `backend/trigger_store.py`

- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-01** — Define `TriggerRecord` as a `TypedDict` matching the schema above
- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-02** — Implement `load_store() -> dict` and `save_store(store: dict)`: read from / write to `triggers.json`; initialize with `{}` if file missing or malformed
- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-03** — Implement `create_trigger(keywords, description, resolution) -> TriggerRecord`: merges user input + LLM resolution, assigns `uuid4` id, sets `enabled=True`, persists
- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-04** — Implement `list_triggers() -> list[TriggerRecord]`: returns all stored triggers
- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-05** — Implement `update_trigger(id: str, patch: dict) -> TriggerRecord | None`: applies partial update (used for enable/disable), persists
- [ ] **TRIG-STORE-06** — Implement `delete_trigger(id: str) -> bool`: removes by id, persists, returns `False` if id not found

---

### RUNNER — `backend/trigger_runner.py`

- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-01** — Implement `match_triggers(text: str, triggers: list[TriggerRecord], mode: str = "fuzzy") -> list[TriggerRecord]`:
  - For each enabled trigger, generate n-grams from transcript and RapidFuzz-match against trigger keywords (threshold ≥ 85)
  - Return all triggers with at least one keyword matched
- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-02** — Implement `extract_field_value(data: dict, path: str) -> any`:
  - Walk a JSON response using a dot-notation path with array support (e.g. `"skaters[0].powerPlayGoals"`)
  - Return `None` if path does not exist (never raise)
- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-03** — Implement `run_trigger(trigger: TriggerRecord) -> dict | None`:
  - Substitute `{param}` placeholders in endpoint URL using `trigger["path_params"]`
  - `httpx.AsyncClient` GET request with 5s timeout
  - For each stored field, call `extract_field_value` on the response JSON
  - Return `None` if HTTP error or timeout
- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-04** — Implement `build_trigger_payload(trigger: TriggerRecord, values: dict) -> dict`:
  - Assemble the `TriggerPayload` shape with `type: "trigger"`, keyword(s), field label/value pairs, and a `display` string
- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-05** — Unit test `match_triggers` with 4 cases:
  - Exact keyword match → trigger returned
  - Fuzzy match (misspelling) → trigger returned
  - Unrelated transcript → empty list
  - Disabled trigger → not returned even if keyword matches
- [ ] **TRIG-RUN-06** — Unit test `extract_field_value` with nested paths, array paths, and missing paths

---

### API ROUTES — `backend/server.py`

- [ ] **TRIG-API-01** — `POST /triggers`:
  - Body: `{ "keywords": list[str], "description": str }`
  - Calls `resolve_trigger` → `create_trigger`
  - Returns the full saved `TriggerRecord` (including resolved endpoint + fields) with `201`
  - Returns `422` with error message if resolver finds no matching endpoint
- [ ] **TRIG-API-02** — `GET /triggers`:
  - Returns `list[TriggerRecord]` with `200`
- [ ] **TRIG-API-03** — `PATCH /triggers/{id}`:
  - Body: `{ "enabled": bool }` (and any other patchable fields)
  - Returns updated `TriggerRecord` or `404`
- [ ] **TRIG-API-04** — `DELETE /triggers/{id}`:
  - Returns `204` on success, `404` if not found
- [ ] **TRIG-API-05** — Wire `trigger_runner` into the main audio pipeline in `main.py`:
  - After `extract_entities()` resolves, also call `match_triggers(text, list_triggers())`
  - For each matched trigger, `await run_trigger(trigger)` concurrently (use `asyncio.gather`)
  - `broadcast(build_trigger_payload(...))` for each result

---

### FRONTEND — `useTriggers.ts`

- [ ] **TRIG-FE-01** — Define TypeScript types:
  ```ts
  type TriggerField  = { path: string; label: string; type: string }
  type TriggerRecord = { id: string; keywords: string[]; description: string; endpoint: string; fields: TriggerField[]; notes: string | null; enabled: boolean }
  ```
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-02** — Implement `useTriggers()` hook:
  - `triggers`: `TriggerRecord[]` state, fetched from `GET /triggers` on mount
  - `createTrigger(keywords, description)`: `POST /triggers`, appends result to state; returns full record for preview
  - `toggleTrigger(id, enabled)`: `PATCH /triggers/{id}`, updates state in place
  - `deleteTrigger(id)`: `DELETE /triggers/{id}`, removes from state
  - `loading`: boolean, `error`: string | null

---

### FRONTEND — `TriggerBuilder.tsx`

- [ ] **TRIG-FE-03** — Build keyword tag input: type a word + press Enter/comma to add it; max 3 tags; remove tag with ×
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-04** — Build description textarea with a character limit (200 chars)
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-05** — Submit button calls `createTrigger`; show spinner + "Resolving endpoint…" label during the API call
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-06** — On success: render a **resolution preview panel** before final save:
  - Show resolved endpoint URL
  - List each field: label + JSON path
  - Show notes if present
  - Two buttons: **Save Trigger** (persists) and **Cancel** (discards without saving)
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-07** — On failure (resolver returns no endpoint): show inline error message; let user edit and retry
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-08** — On confirmed save: clear the form, close preview, and add the new trigger to `TriggerList`

---

### FRONTEND — `TriggerList.tsx`

- [ ] **TRIG-FE-09** — Render each trigger as a row: keywords (as badges), description (truncated), endpoint URL, enabled toggle, delete button
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-10** — Enabled toggle calls `toggleTrigger`; optimistic UI update
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-11** — Delete button shows a confirmation dialog before calling `deleteTrigger`
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-12** — Empty state: "No triggers yet. Create one above."

---

### FRONTEND — `TriggerCard.tsx`

- [ ] **TRIG-FE-13** — Create `TriggerCard` accepting props: `payload: TriggerPayload`, `onExpire: () => void`
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-14** — Style: keyword(s) as a purple/violet header badge; each `{ label, value }` field pair on its own line
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-15** — Reuse the same slide-in + fade-out animation as `StatCard`
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-16** — Auto-expire: `setTimeout(onExpire, 8000)` on mount

---

### FRONTEND — `OverlayCanvas.tsx` + `useOverlaySocket.ts`

- [ ] **TRIG-FE-17** — Add `TriggerPayload` to the `StatPayload` union type in `useOverlaySocket.ts`:
  ```ts
  type TriggerPayload = { type: "trigger"; id: string; keywords: string[]; fields: { label: string; value: any }[]; display: string }
  type StatPayload    = PlayerPayload | TeamPayload | TriggerPayload
  ```
- [ ] **TRIG-FE-18** — Add `type === "trigger"` case to `OverlayCanvas`'s card router → renders `<TriggerCard>`

---

### INTEGRATION & TESTS

- [ ] **TRIG-INT-01** — Integration test: create a trigger via `POST /triggers` with a real description, verify the stored record has a non-null endpoint and at least one field
- [ ] **TRIG-INT-02** — Integration test: simulate a transcript match, verify `run_trigger` returns a non-null payload with populated field values
- [ ] **TRIG-INT-03** — End-to-end test: create a trigger from the frontend UI, speak the keyword into the mic (or feed a test audio file), verify a `TriggerCard` appears on the overlay
- [ ] **TRIG-INT-04** — Verify disabled triggers are never matched during live audio even if keyword is present in transcript
- [ ] **TRIG-INT-05** — Verify triggers persist across a backend restart (loaded from `triggers.json` on startup)

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Editing a trigger's description or keywords after creation (delete + recreate instead)
- Multiple field extraction strategies (e.g. aggregate, filter, sort) — MVP extracts raw field values only
- Trigger ordering or priority when multiple triggers match simultaneously
- Persistent trigger history / audit log
